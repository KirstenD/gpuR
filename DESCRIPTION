Title: GPU Functions for R Objects
Description: Provides GPU enabled functions for R objects in a simple and 
    approachable manner.  New gpu* and vcl* classes have been provided to 
    wrap typical R objects (e.g. vector, matrix), in both host and device 
    spaces, to mirror typical R syntax without the need to know OpenCL.
