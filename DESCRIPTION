Description: This package was developed to provide GPU enabled functions
    for R objects in the most simple and approachable manner possible.  New
    gpu classes have been provided to wrap typical R objects 
    (e.g. vector, matrix) and big.matrix objects and utilize typical R
    syntax without the need to know OpenCL.
