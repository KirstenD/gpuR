gpuR

========

This package is currently only functional for Linux systems.
In order for it to work you will need to install the
clBLAS library which is managed by another GPU library (ArrayFire).

To install follow this short script

# Install Boost & OpenCL headers
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev opencl-headers

# Install clBLAS
git clone https://github.com/arrayfire/clBLAS.git
cd clBLAS
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../src -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
sudo make install # installs to build/package

Afterwards, the package should function correctly.  This 
package is in its very early stages and therefore subject
to many changes.
