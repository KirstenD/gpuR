gpuR

========

This package is currently only functional for Linux systems.
In order for it to work you will need to install a
SDK for your respective gpu(s) and the opencl-headers.
Follow your vendor specific instructions to install.

To install follow this short script

# Install Boost & OpenCL headers
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev opencl-headers

Afterwards, the package should function correctly.  This 
package is in its very early stages and therefore subject
to many changes.
